#AWS Data Engineering Projects

#Welcome to My Learning Journey!


This repository is a personal collection of my data engineering projects as I explore and master various AWS services. It's a living record of my learning journey, where each project represents a step forward in my understanding of data engineering in the cloud. Currently, the focus is on leveraging AWS technologies to build scalable, efficient, and robust data solutions.

#ðŸŒŸ Current Project: Sales Inventory Analysis
Overview: Dive into the world of sales data with our inaugural project! Utilizing Amazon S3 for data storage and Amazon Athena for serverless querying, this project offers a glimpse into the power of AWS for data analysis. Follow along in a Jupyter Notebook as we transform raw sales inventory data into actionable insights.

#Key Features:

Data Storage with Amazon S3: Learn how to organize and store your sales data efficiently in S3 buckets.
Serverless Querying with Amazon Athena: Discover the ease of executing SQL queries on your S3-stored data using Athena, without the need for a traditional database.
Analysis in Jupyter Notebooks: See the data come to life through analysis and visualization directly in a Jupyter Notebook.
