**AWS Data Engineering Projects**

**Welcome to My Learning Journey!**

This repository is a personal collection of my data engineering projects as I explore and master various AWS services. It's a living record of my learning journey, where each project represents a step forward in my understanding of data engineering in the cloud. Currently, the focus is on leveraging AWS technologies to build scalable, efficient, and robust data solutions.

üõ† **Project 1: Autogen Agents for Interview Practice**
Overview: This project focuses on using LLM-based agents to assist in interview preparation. Each agent is tailored to specialize in a specific type of interview, such as technical, behavioral, and case-based questions. The goal is to provide a practical and interactive platform where users can practice for interviews in a targeted and effective manner.

**Key Features:**
Specialized Agents:
Technical Agent: Assists in coding interviews, data structure problems, and algorithmic challenges.
Behavioral Agent: Simulates HR and behavioral interview scenarios, helping users refine their storytelling and communication skills.
Case-Based Agent: Prepares users for analytical and problem-solving interviews by simulating real-world case studies.
Interactive Conversations: Built using Autogen to provide a seamless conversational experience tailored to the interview type.
Customization: Users can adjust difficulty levels and question formats based on their preparation stage.
Future Integration: Plans to include feedback mechanisms where the agents provide constructive suggestions for improvement.

Current Status:
The project is still in progress. The foundational agents have been built, and the current focus is on developing an intuitive front-end interface for the platform to enhance user interaction and accessibility.

üåü **Project 2: Sales Inventory Analysis**
Overview: Dive into the world of sales data with our inaugural project! Utilizing Amazon S3 for data storage and Amazon Athena for serverless querying, this project offers a glimpse into the power of AWS for data analysis. Follow along in a Jupyter Notebook as we transform raw sales inventory data into actionable insights.

**Key Features:**

Data Storage with Amazon S3: Learn how to organize and store your sales data efficiently in S3 buckets.
Serverless Querying with Amazon Athena: Discover the ease of executing SQL queries on your S3-stored data using Athena, without the need for a traditional database.
Analysis in Jupyter Notebooks: See the data come to life through analysis and visualization directly in a Jupyter Notebook.

üåê **Project 3: ChatGPT Integration with AWS Lambda**
Overview: This project demonstrates how to integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT with AWS Lambda to create a seamless serverless application. User input is received through an API Gateway, processed by AWS Lambda, and the response is generated using the OpenAI API. The resulting response is stored in an S3 bucket for easy access and retrieval.

**Key Features:**
User Input Handling: API Gateway receives and forwards user input to the Lambda function.
Serverless Processing: AWS Lambda utilizes the OpenAI API to process the input and generate a response dynamically.
Response Storage: Generated responses are stored in Amazon S3 for persistence and future use.
Scalability and Efficiency: This serverless approach showcases the potential of combining AI capabilities with AWS infrastructure.
